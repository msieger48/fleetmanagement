# Welcome to OpenRemote's Fleet Management Repository!

This repository contains the OpenRemote custom project template that contains full support for fleet management features, like location tracking and session tracking, and also the industry-first complete, automatic data recognition from any Teltonika Telematics device model.

Please look at the wiki for the tutorial on how to set up your ownfleet management system, and the Developer Guide to understand the inner workings of the fleet management implementation.


# Custom Project Format

To create the OpenRemote fleet management integration, a new custom project was created using [OpenRemote's custom-project template](https://github.com/openremote/custom-project). To view the changes of files between the original custom-project repository and the current state of the repository, press [here]( https://github.com/openremote/fleet-management/compare/668ae6fdfb20eeae5977ad62b655bf3fb3d58cdd...main). In this way, you can see the files that have been added since the creation of this repository. 

This repository uses the [feature/fleet-management](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/tree/feature/fleet-management) branch of the main OpenRemote repository as its core, specifically for adding more UI-related features. If the UI features are not something that interest you, you're encouraged to change the submodule to use the `master` OpenRemote branch.
